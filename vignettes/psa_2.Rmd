Define health states for mono therapy - now the costs are just defined, 
but not defined any value.


This document demonstrates development of a  Markov model explained in 
reference \ref[alarid2020cohort] using this package "packDAMipd". This 
model is explained in STM_02.R file in Cohort-modeling-tutorial provided in 
DARTH-git github page.

Here we look at how the model is defined when the transition probabilities (or parameters) are dependent on the model cycle or time. (Another example for 
considering 


Define health states. Each health state must have a name, cost, and utility. 
The cost and utility are the state values. That means the individuals having 
the state membership will occur the particular cost and utility. If any 
cost/utility due to transitions occur, they need to specify similar to defining 
the transition probabilities.

```{r}
H <- health_state("H", cost = "c_H ", utility = "u_H")
S1 <- health_state("S1", cost = "c_S1",utility = "u_S1")
S2 <- health_state("S2", cost = "c_S2",utility = "u_S2")
D <- health_state("D", cost = "c_D ",utility = "u_D")
```

Define allowed transition probabilities and number them. The below matrix is 
numbered so that the maximum entry in the matrix gives the total number of 
allowed transitions. Column names and row names are just the names of the 
health states."NA" indicates a non allowed transition. 
```{r}
tmat <- rbind(c(1, 2, NA, 3), c(4, 5, 6, 7),c(NA, NA, 8, 9), c(NA, NA, NA, 10))
colnames(tmat) <- rownames(tmat) <- c("H","S1" ,"S2","D")
```

As there is cost and utility during some transitions, we define tmat_cost and tmat_utility similar to defining transition probability. Again only non zero transition cost and transition utility are non NA.

```{r}
tmat_cost <- rbind(c(NA, 1, NA, 2), c(NA, NA, NA, 3),c(NA, NA, NA, 4), 
                   c(NA, NA, NA, NA))
colnames(tmat_cost) <- rownames(tmat_cost) <- c("H", "S1", "S2", "D")
tmat_util <- rbind(c(NA, 1, NA, NA), c(NA, NA, NA, NA),c(NA, NA, NA, NA), 
                   c(NA, NA, NA, NA))
colnames(tmat_util) <- rownames(tmat_util) <- c("H", "S1", "S2", "D")
```

Now we define the transition matrix , transition cost matrix and transition 
utility matrix (the latter two are optional,we use only if there are 
cost/utility during transitions) using the tmat defined earlier, and number of
health states. Note that the probabilities are age dependent (when compared to 
simple sick sicker model and are named differently to indicate the age 
dependency)

```{r}
tm <- populate_transition_matrix(4, tmat, c("p_HH","p_HS1","p_HDage","p_S1H",
                                   "p_S1S1", "p_S1S2", "p_S1Dage",
                                   "p_S2S2","p_S2Dage","p_DD" ), 
                                 colnames(tmat))
tm_cost <- transition_cost_util(4, tmat_cost, c("ic_HS1","ic_D","ic_D","ic_D"), colnames(tmat_cost))
tm_util <- transition_cost_util(4, tmat_util, c("du_HS1" ), colnames(tmat_util))
```
Now define the parameter list using define_parameters(). If there is any 
formula or expression to be evaluated during the cycle, it has be given as a 
string (see below). For example. p_S1D is calculated using a formula with 
parameters p_HD and hr_S1 and is thus given as a string expression. Here the 
mortality rates are age dependent, thus each cycle, the age of the cohort is 
to be calculated to determine the mortality. We read the mortality data from 
the provided data file as shown below. The dependency is thus defined by using 
the keyword "Markov_cycle" for the current cycle.

```{r}
mortality_file = system.file("extdata", "LifeTable_USA_Mx_2015.csv",  package = "packDAMipd")
param_list <- define_parameters(age_init = 25,
                      mortality_age = "get_mortality_from_file(mortality_file, age_init - 1 + markov_cycle, \"total\")",
                      p_HDage = "1-exp(-mortality_age)", p_HS1  = 0.15, 
                      p_S1H = 0.5,
                      p_S1S2  = 0.105, hr_S1   = 3,hr_S2   = 10,
                      p_S1Dage  =  "1-exp(-mortality_age *hr_S1)",
                      p_S2Dage  = "1-exp(-mortality_age *hr_S2)",
                      p_HH = "1 - (p_HS1 + p_HDage)",
                      p_S1S1 = "1 - (p_S1H + p_S1S2+ p_S1Dage)",
                      p_S2S2 = "1 - ( p_S2Dage)",
                      p_DD = 1,
                      c_H   = 2000,c_S1  = 4000,c_S2  = 15000,
                      c_D   = 0, c_Trt = 12000,u_H   = 1,
                      u_S1  = 0.75, u_S2  = 0.5,u_D   = 0,
                      u_Trt = 0.95, du_HS1 = -0.01, ic_HS1 = 1000, ic_D = 2000)
```

We define the strategy "Usual care" by using the function 'strategy' with the 
health states combined (using combine_state()), the transition matrix (tm), 
transition cost and utility matrices. Using the defined strategy 'uc_strategy', 
we run the Markov model using Markov_model() with cycles, initial states, 
initial cost, initial utility values, discount rates and parameter list. 
The results of the Markov model (trace matrix) can be plotted using 
plot_model() function.

```{r}
health_states <- combine_state(H,S1,S2,D)
uc_strategy <- strategy(tm, health_states, "Usual care",tm_cost,tm_util)

uc_markov <- markov_model(current_strategy = uc_strategy, cycles = 85, 
                          initial_state = c(1, 0,0,0), discount = c(0.03,0.03), parameter_values = param_list, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE,
                          method = "half cycle correction")
# png("states.png")
# plot_model(uc_markov)
# dev.off()
```

Similarly, we define the health states, strategy, and Markov model for the "New treatment". Parameter list is the same as that defined for the usual care. 
Costs for the health states in the new treatment strategy differs, thus we 
need to redefine the health states.


```{r}
H <- health_state("H", cost = "c_H ", utility = "u_H")
S1 <- health_state("S1", cost = "c_S1 + c_Trt ",utility = "u_Trt")
S2 <- health_state("S2", cost = "c_S2 + c_Trt",utility = "u_S2")
D <- health_state("D", cost = "c_D ",utility = "u_D")
health_states <- combine_state(H,S1,S2,D)
trt_strategy <- strategy(tm, health_states, "New treatment",tm_cost,tm_util)
trt_markov <- markov_model(current_strategy = trt_strategy, cycles = 85, 
                           initial_state = c(1, 0,0,0), discount = c(0.03,0.03),parameter_values = param_list,TRUE, FALSE, FALSE ,
                           method = "half cycle correction")

# png("trt.png")
# plot_model(trt_markov)
write.csv(trt_markov$utility_matrix, "util_trt.csv")
write.csv(uc_markov$utility_matrix, "util_uc.csv")

write.csv(trt_markov$cost_matrix, "cost_trt.csv")
write.csv(uc_markov$cost_matrix, "cost_uc.csv")
```

Once we have the results form the Markov models for both the strategies, we 
combine these two to define list_Markov. Finally we obtain incremental cost effectiveness ratio (ICER) and net monetary benefit (NMB) for the cost
effectiveness analysis using the function calculate_icer_nmb(). 
For calculating NMB, threshold value  and the name of the comparator should be provided, while for plotting CEAC, range of values of thresholds should be 
provided along with the name of the comparator.

The \ref[alarid2020cohort]   reports the results as follows which is the same as obtained using packDAMipd.

The cost of usual care obtained from STM_02.R of Cohort-modeling-tutorial in 
DARTH-git package is  115,415 USD while that of the new treatment is 212,867 USD.
The QALYs for the usual care and the new treatment are 19.460 and 20.157 
respectively. The ICER obtained is 139,794   
 
```{r}
list_markov <- combine_markov(uc_markov, trt_markov)
cal <- calculate_icer_nmb(list_markov, threshold = 65000, 
                          comparator = "Usual care" )
write.csv(cal, "icer_nmb.csv" )
```

```{r}
#plot_nmb_lambda(list_markov,threshold_values = c(20000, 40000, 60000, 80000), 
#          comparator = "Usual care" , currency = "USD")
#plot_efficiency_frontier(cal, 20000)

```


```{r}
sample_list <- define_parameters(u_Trt = "normal(mean = 0.95, sd = 0.02)",
                                 c_Trt = "normal(mean = 12000, sd = 1000)")
param_table_mono <- define_parameters_psa(param_list, sample_list)
param_table_combo <- define_parameters_psa(param_list, sample_list)
result_psa_mono = do_psa(uc_markov, param_table_mono, 50)
result_psa_comb = do_psa(trt_markov, param_table_combo, 50)

list_result_psa_mono <- list_paramwise_psa_result(result_psa_mono, NULL, NULL, 
                                                  NULL)

                                      "Usual care")
